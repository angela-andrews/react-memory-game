# A Different World Click Game

I was a HUGE fan of A Different World. It was the first time I could remember seeing black people, living full and exciting lives on a college campus. Week in and week out, we saw students from all of that came to Hillman Collge for the HBCU experience.  When I was giving this assignment, I knew I wanted to pay homage to this classic television series.

##  What the project does
This project is a great introduction to React. It using many of the basic React building blocks like props, classes, and onClick events. 

## How to Play
Point your browser to [https://angela-andrews.github.io/react-memory-game/]
Click on a character, one at a time without duplicating your selections. Get all 10 in a row and Win. If you make a mistake, the board will reshuffle and you'll have to start all over again. Good luck!
