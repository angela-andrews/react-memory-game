# A Different World Click Game

I was a HUGE fan of A Different World. It was the first time I could remember seeing black people, living full and exciting lives on a college campus. Week in and week out, we saw students from all of that came to Hillman Collge for the HBCU experience.  When I was giving this assignment, I knew I wanted to pay homage to this classic television series.
